## Description

CrowdDistance, a Deep Learning and GeoLocation based service that enables users and organizations to maintain the appropriate physical distance and avoid contracting the Coronavirus. Our ComputerVision-driven solution caters to both the community and business industries in providing the appropriate analytical tools that benefit each of them.

The solution ingests data from surveillance camera feeds to chart crowd density data and place circular markers on a mapping service that depicts the number of people in an area. Users can take advantage of the crowd data and heatmap visualizations on the map to avoid crowded areas. This will help the community to better plan and avoid highly-dense areas prior to actually traveling to their destination.

Additionally, CrowdDistance provides a Crowd Analytics Dashboard to accurately depict specific social distance violations and alert the security personnel to disperse any emerging crowd. Moreover, organizations can take advantage of Real-time Graphs and Motion HeatMap Visualizations to gather actionable insights in providing a safe environment for their employees. This is yet another step that organizations can take to “Accelerate the New normal” for the post-lockdown days.
